[10/1/17, 9:07:25 AM] <ShapaLapaDingDong> @CaptnCosmic Prove it or I kill you
[10/1/17, 9:07:27 AM] <Swagatha_Christie> yeah that logo wouldn't read at smaller sizes
[10/1/17, 9:07:27 AM] <willgasm> yeah, it's gonna be tiny
[10/1/17, 9:07:27 AM] <S2PENDOUS> is there a new version of the g303?
[10/1/17, 9:07:28 AM] <phi_quach> too much for a logo
[10/1/17, 9:07:30 AM] <iBringTheDeeps> I liked the second oen
[10/1/17, 9:07:30 AM] <Tin_Cantankerous21> its a little too pointy like a metal album phone
[10/1/17, 9:07:30 AM] <Thatpenguin> minimalism is key. here is my design for Shroud. ez. get ready. S

[10/1/17, 9:07:45 AM] <kanilas> It's not bad, but the base is the best version. What it doesn't really have though is enough of a connection to Shroud, C9, or what he does aside from the "S" shape.
[10/1/17, 9:07:46 AM] <MZ648> good art work , but it doesn't suit you @shroud

[10/1/17, 9:12:33 AM] <grizvok> how do you do the jump through windows?
[10/1/17, 9:12:36 AM] <RedPls> LuL
[10/1/17, 9:12:37 AM] <Postboy> Shroud's shirt comes from buying the Japanese version of PUBG from DMM

[10/1/17, 9:13:06 AM] <natherz> @grizvok you have to crouch jump which is pressing w ctrl and c at the same time
[10/1/17, 9:13:07 AM] <Allerend> RAPE ROOM
[10/1/17, 9:13:08 AM] <jcurlee710> @Grizvok SPACE BAR AND C AT THE SAME TIME
[10/1/17, 9:13:09 AM] <GLOOTnFOREBEAST> its okay, but just too much detail for a logo. Try to keep in mind that a logo usually goes on merchandise i.e. small print on shirts and hats. so too musch detail doesn't look good.
[10/1/17, 9:13:12 AM] <Minstrel_Rage> @SenseiiOG looks like a cartoon

[10/1/17, 9:13:36 AM] <grizvok> can you hit shift to run too? or does hitting shift fuck it up?
[10/1/17, 9:13:37 AM] <ravingbacchians> @SenseiiOG also because of the 9 curves it make the letting fit wayy more

[10/1/17, 9:26:10 AM] <s_afe> @FreeTheRock123 you dont have to pass a test to get a degree. You design stuff and constantly redesign. Other students and the teachers who have had years of expeirience critique your work and show you how to be better. most art classes are not "tests" unless its a history of that art.

[10/1/17, 10:57:30 AM] <anticoldttv> the random sprays in this game arent consistent with real guns. Real guns repeat the same pattern unless they overheat. The devs shouldn't have put that mechanic in the game.

[10/1/17, 12:25:50 PM] <OMGapotatoe> @shroud you should try surround sound. The problem you described earlier with determining where sounds are coming from kind of solves that. at least for me, i can tell the exact direction. when i change to stereo, it's harder to tell
