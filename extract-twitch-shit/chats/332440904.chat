[11/7/18, 2:58:27 AM] <GnarDoodle> Is this chat so unoriginal that it has to copy and paste other peoples’ messages? It’s not funny and gets a bit repetitive. Come up with something original for once, and maybe you will find that people enjoy your messages. Perhaps you may even get a gifted sub for your troubles.
