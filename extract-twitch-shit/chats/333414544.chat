[11/9/18, 2:46:18 PM] <N1nruD> -

[11/9/18, 2:46:36 PM] <HarvYBook> can't tell if you're memeing, -9.5 against MLW is risky yo
[11/9/18, 2:46:58 PM] <HarvYBook> MLW have a real chance to bring this to double digits imo
[11/9/18, 2:47:04 PM] <y3wkor1314> -8.5 Grayhound sorry
[11/9/18, 2:47:23 PM] <FarshotCF> +2.5 mLw 4Head
[11/9/18, 2:47:28 PM] <HarvYBook> Still pretty risky, but good luck
[11/9/18, 2:48:27 PM] <snekk__> why do -8.5

[11/9/18, 2:48:56 PM] <HarvYBook> Man has big balls and big account, wants to win big
[11/9/18, 2:49:29 PM] <SpotTheOzzieTV> -8.5 even on Principle is such a big outside score to cover. If MLW get on a 3-4 round run, you're bet is basically toast due to economy.
[11/9/18, 2:49:52 PM] <HarvYBook> True, super risky
[11/9/18, 2:50:03 PM] <HarvYBook> I see double digits, but then again worse has happened before
