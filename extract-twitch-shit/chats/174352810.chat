[9/13/17, 7:07:44 AM] <Nunaq> @OfficialFriberg About the aimpunch, hear me out on this: This might actually make people stop buying armor on pistol rounds if the aimpunch isn't that bad, creating a greater emphasis on nade usage during pistol rounds.

[9/13/17, 7:25:07 AM] <Esc4pe_> thats just a joke fucking volvo
[9/13/17, 7:25:10 AM] <Chrawnus> @OfficialFriberg I think I might have figured out how to parse the sv_showimpactspenetration info when you shot with p250. I think it's (base damage x headshot multiplier) - (lost damage x headshot multiplier), which would be (38 x 4) - (19.3 x 4) which would come out at 74.8 damage
