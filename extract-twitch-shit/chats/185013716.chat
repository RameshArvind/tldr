For people like me who don't have the ability to spend money in the game it's kind of difficult to play BDO efficiently.

[10/26/17, 12:30:54 AM] <TheOnlyZh> @shroud so how do you decide when to use ak or scar
[10/26/17, 12:30:55 AM] <milesisbad> Edibles are difficult because even after you're completely stoned your body keeps digesting the edibles and just saturating your blood with THC so you keep getting more high. And the effect is always odd in my experience. 100MG consumed orally is a HUGE amount for any non-constant smoker. Even everyday smokers can get completely stoned from 50MG, take it from an experienced user. IF you want to know more check out /r/trees on Reddit they have a lot of good information!

[10/26/17, 12:50:53 AM] <blokhd> In the US, you can have automatic figles, but you need a level 3 FFL

[10/26/17, 12:51:09 AM] <blokhd> No, they're not illegal.
[10/26/17, 12:51:09 AM] <Trevizyn> Its just a military style weapon, you can get a locemse tp pwm tnjpse
[10/26/17, 12:51:10 AM] <jueeerrrgen> auto ARs are legal they're just hella expensive to own/keep a license

[10/26/17, 12:51:18 AM] <CaptMcAwes0me> you can have a personal auto AR, just need the license which is super expensive
[10/26/17, 12:51:21 AM] <Syphlor> You can buy a fucking ak47 at walmart
[10/26/17, 12:51:24 AM] <Nexdeus88> I've shot an automatic AR in the U.S., I live in Texas, and people tend to have those illegal guns on their "ranch" properties
[10/26/17, 12:51:25 AM] <pozhinat> Theres gunranges all over the hotels in Las vegas
[10/26/17, 12:51:25 AM] <ARN3wman> @shroud Shotguns hurt, pistols are fun and rifles are really cool. Usually at a gun range, you set it down on a table and use a scope so its not really hard
[10/26/17, 12:51:26 AM] <0impact> you just cant own them without a license

[10/26/17, 1:16:18 AM] <Phogetful> @shroud the ASUS boards for threadripper are failing like crazy because of the FOXXCON retention mechanism. There's a bunch of videos popping up about them on YouTube.

[10/26/17, 1:16:22 AM] <LeftClickLegendTV> @Grandcriminal he specifically said the opposite...
[10/26/17, 1:16:23 AM] <DaddyLace> I've literally ran AMD all my life and never once had an issue with the cpu.
[10/26/17, 1:16:34 AM] <Nexdeus88> @shroud I'll build you a system, full custom water loop with hard line tubing. I charge 10% of the total purchase price of the parts.
[10/26/17, 1:16:36 AM] <Trevizyn> @matt555666 I agree, however in some cases I get really low framerates, as opposed to an Intel chip would be like double what I have

[10/26/17, 1:18:36 AM] <aquaticMisanthrope> @iMachine7 Not necessarily, plenty of games arew more CPU heavy than they are GPU. But most games don't get better performance out of more cores because they have bad multicore optimization, so it's better to have fewer cores that have higher speeds.

[10/26/17, 1:19:32 AM] <williamwu1995> We want higher resolution!!!
[10/26/17, 1:19:32 AM] <drkz1m> @shroud do you have a keyboard to recommend? looking for a new one
[10/26/17, 1:19:35 AM] <ambidexi> more stutter, more detail
[10/26/17, 1:19:36 AM] <Solahmi> it makes it a hell of a lot tougher for some to watch at 720p 60fps @shroud
[10/26/17, 1:19:38 AM] <xmasLights> @CanadianKub dont need to replace GPU usually, cpu\mobo\ram.
[10/26/17, 1:19:38 AM] <Matt555666> @shroud you'd need a new MOBO to upgrade to the 8700K which has 6 cores 12 threads. You're 7700K is better at GAMING because the single core performance is higher!!
[10/26/17, 1:19:38 AM] <ifomas> cores dont dedicate to layer 7

[10/26/17, 1:19:59 AM] <ostrichmen> @matt555666 I haven't messed with it since initial overclock tbh
[10/26/17, 1:20:00 AM] <Nexdeus88> Those saying the 8700k is 25-35% faster, it has 2 more cores, that's why it's faster in multi threaded applications. Single core performance is about the same.
[10/26/17, 1:20:03 AM] <Flying_space_giraffes> yes he would
[10/26/17, 1:20:06 AM] <ostrichmen> I'll look into it
[10/26/17, 1:20:07 AM] <Clennan> cleaner image, slightly more clunky with stutter at 7k
[10/26/17, 1:20:09 AM] <AkiHeartt> OhISee
[10/26/17, 1:20:11 AM] <Flying_space_giraffes> he would need new mobo
[10/26/17, 1:20:18 AM] <xmasLights> 7700k\8700k are literally almost the same single core performance
[10/26/17, 1:20:19 AM] <4nth0ny6> missed a kar98
[10/26/17, 1:20:21 AM] <Dan_of_Earth> @shroud keep[ in mind the bit rate is only as good as the viewrs internet capability
[10/26/17, 1:20:23 AM] <LoserGeekNerd> The per core perforamnce is exactly the same, it just has 2 more.
[10/26/17, 1:20:24 AM] <Trevizyn> Nah @Flying_space_giraffes intel said it could be compatible I think
[10/26/17, 1:20:25 AM] <Syphlor> No he wouldn't for his gaming rig. remember mike has two PCs
[10/26/17, 1:20:29 AM] <MikiCBP> I think ther is a new i3 i5 i7 wiht like 7 cores i don't relly know

[10/26/17, 1:20:54 AM] <Treello> if your streaming from the same rig your playing on the extra cores willhelp
[10/26/17, 1:20:54 AM] <williamwu1995> It’s literally the same if not better single core performance... with lower power consumption and more cores/threads

[10/26/17, 1:51:23 AM] <MrWWonka> amazon owns twitch?
[10/26/17, 1:51:23 AM] <hugepwnr> probably encourages people to actually sub with money
[10/26/17, 1:51:23 AM] <st0neh> Amazon is probably eating the loss

[10/26/17, 1:51:31 AM] <DU0RHS> It’s for the prime users
[10/26/17, 1:51:31 AM] <dLoathing> twitch is owned by amazon
[10/26/17, 1:51:32 AM] <nessquicc> it makes people watch twitch more which makes them sub to more people and buy bits and such. Its business

[10/26/17, 1:51:57 AM] <The_Wreckless> well doesnt amazon prime cost more then a twitch sub?
[10/26/17, 1:51:57 AM] <LiddleTrucker> Prime cost went up, thus rolling the twitch prime sub into the premium @shroud

[10/26/17, 1:52:04 AM] <GuKilljoy> Amazon gets the exposure for prime out on twitch and thus makes umbrella company money and ideally offsets the 5 dollar "loss"
[10/26/17, 1:52:06 AM] <patrikz> Amazon prime is of higher concern I would guess = making more money

[10/26/17, 1:52:24 AM] <ImmanuelCat> @shroud so Amazon prime is 100$ a year and you only get 60$ worth of free subs a year so 40$ profit for amazon which owns twitch.
[10/26/17, 1:52:25 AM] <PineappleKillerBaz> Level 3 bag missed
[10/26/17, 1:52:27 AM] <Zincarite> Advertisement. More additions to amazon prime makes it sell more. With prime video, twitch prime, etc it makes it more appealing

[10/26/17, 1:52:40 AM] <Neglectedasian> shroud Amazon is bigger than twitch, free promotion for their other owned company, twitch. Attempts to expand twitches audienc
[10/26/17, 1:52:41 AM] <MrWWonka> LUL
[10/26/17, 1:52:42 AM] <williamwu1995> It’s an incentive. It encourages people to regular sub. It’s also mutually beneficial for amazon as a platform in general.
[10/26/17, 1:52:42 AM] <celticjemima> amazon is worth 500 billion

[10/26/17, 7:25:05 AM] <Thatpenguin> sec-engineer. for an anti cheat to be "Great again" it has to be more invasive than esea's current anti cheat. esea's anti cheat is still getting bypassed.
[10/26/17, 7:25:06 AM] <RawOperation> BattleEye is actually a really good anticheat any whoever says otherwise doesn't know what they're talking about
[10/26/17, 7:25:08 AM] <OterXQ> @Mentalstatemike I clipped shroud explaining the sub noise (and plugging his youtube) if you wanna make it into a command. You can do that, right? https://clips.twitch.tv/RockyHumbleTrayShadyLulu

[10/26/17, 9:39:11 AM] <OterXQ> @2Slow4Mebro There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE.

[10/26/17, 9:40:51 AM] <OterXQ> @2Slow4Mebro As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them.
