[5/10/17, 10:18:17 AM] <dasaus> waiters/waitresses should have a minimum wage or the restaurant should have prices where they can afford to pay them so that the customer does not have to worry about tipping every time they eat somewhere. does anyone really need someone to carry their food 50 feet to their table, and then comes the case, what if the experience at the restaurant was not enjoyable or the food was sub par or worse

[5/10/17, 11:29:08 AM] <Onebeardd> @shroud this game is way harder to tell if someone is cheating. This game would be so easy to cheat if you just had "walls" per say when just actually aimed. I don't think anyone would ever get caught if they cheated like that.
