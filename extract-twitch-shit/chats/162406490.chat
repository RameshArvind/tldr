[7/28/17, 12:43:37 AM] <SaltyVictor> LUL
[7/28/17, 12:43:42 AM] <TlCKLES> less looting, less chance of player interaction, more camping
[7/28/17, 12:43:42 AM] <maiello> @dopey_v2, desk mic for stream heaset for voip
[7/28/17, 12:43:42 AM] <Kreissieg> IT IS
[7/28/17, 12:43:43 AM] <dopplerplox> @shroud maybe they do better with underated guns so it's unfair for them
[7/28/17, 12:43:43 AM] <cheeseburgerEddie1> @ralphyxd c9 wont sign him cos they wanna compete in majors
[7/28/17, 12:43:46 AM] <Sqwiffy> just have them play cs LUL
[7/28/17, 12:43:47 AM] <WuggTheOrc_> @shroud the randomness would add so many interesting fights

[7/28/17, 12:43:50 AM] <JamesDouble> Get rid of all the bullshit clothes and balance the loot so you find some of everything and not everything of something especifically @shroud
[7/28/17, 12:43:51 AM] <Darksoulsinvader> @shroud What about a starter kit where you start with a small pistol so that you have a fighting chance?
[7/28/17, 12:43:53 AM] <bwnp> ofc it is
[7/28/17, 12:43:54 AM] <wavyxdd> not sign him right now lol
[7/28/17, 12:43:55 AM] <zaba88> PUBG is worst to watch than a overwatch
[7/28/17, 12:43:55 AM] <D4_is_a_bot> missed glock
[7/28/17, 12:43:56 AM] <Nick_rocky> I just think they should get more areas and put a limit of whatever guns can spawn in that area so every are in the game has a similar amount of loot
[7/28/17, 12:43:56 AM] <what_is_luv> it depends on the players / map ratio.
[7/28/17, 12:43:57 AM] <ky1e9_> he might be inbred

[7/28/17, 12:44:06 AM] <eileen_yulik> Make kills count for more pts depending on weapon add up scores in best of 3 series and make wins and placing give certain amount of pts
[7/28/17, 12:44:07 AM] <swordbird22> yeah, I'd rather just have better guns for everyone which would make for more exciting gameplay imo
[7/28/17, 12:44:07 AM] <Miblik> Just spawn everyone with an AK then. It would be boring as fuck

[7/28/17, 12:44:13 AM] <LazerFTW> @shroud how would the observation even work in the early stages of the game. Would be so hectic
[7/28/17, 12:44:13 AM] <BadDoge> For competitive they should have some randomness but there needs to be min-spawns per area at least

[7/28/17, 12:44:14 AM] <poooopooo> nice counter argument 4Head

[7/28/17, 1:00:50 AM] <dessl0ch> Balancing the game's weapons in a hypothetical comp mode really closes the gaps at a higher level. That will give us more close matches and the better players will rise. Leave it the way it is will give anoyone a chance and an unfair advantage to win games that he shouldn't even be at top 30 alive.

[7/28/17, 4:07:39 AM] <St3fann> @potterfox The only thing in my opinion is better than cs 1.6 is surfing
[7/28/17, 4:07:42 AM] <CaterpillarPaul> People are always getting shot in the back now LUL
[7/28/17, 4:07:45 AM] <MatttyV> and then first person is gonna have bugs and everyone will be complaining again LUL
[7/28/17, 4:07:45 AM] <saladee> I think sounds will because a much larger factor
[7/28/17, 4:07:46 AM] <ThisIsTri> 1st is just going to be a shit show of more luck and rng based play. its not awareness
[7/28/17, 4:07:47 AM] <NYCemir> And the pan can't forget that
[7/28/17, 4:07:49 AM] <kasoysavage> @wiggan92 so what does he means its been pushed back? they did say next monthly update
[7/28/17, 4:07:49 AM] <kurib> The timing for first person have to be extremely lucky
[7/28/17, 4:07:54 AM] <Coyan94> not being able to look fully 360 aronud you, and weapons obstructing vision will add depth

[7/28/17, 4:08:01 AM] <boohahalul> itll be harder to return fire after ur being shot at in fps, thatll be nice
[7/28/17, 4:08:01 AM] <Pixal88> xD
[7/28/17, 4:08:04 AM] <HillOrc> the only thing better than cs 1.6 is literally anything u can do away from a computer
[7/28/17, 4:08:04 AM] <oqpo> @St3fann SeemsGood agree
[7/28/17, 4:08:04 AM] <Mandorake> @shroud even looting is harder in first person. You have to really pay attention
[7/28/17, 4:08:08 AM] <jenniferconnelly> @thisistri lol you say that because you need your 3pp crutch lol
[7/28/17, 4:08:11 AM] <trey_15> i think you should just first person this game to practice for next month
[7/28/17, 4:08:12 AM] <damg0n> Guys. shroud have Polish roots?
[7/28/17, 4:08:13 AM] <Epoori> its totally ruining point of the strategy at the game

[7/28/17, 4:08:28 AM] <ayuminor> In third person you could be constantly scanning but for all you know there's a guy in every ditch and behind every tree just looking at you.
[7/28/17, 4:08:29 AM] <Bloomkail> Did they win last game ?
[7/28/17, 4:08:29 AM] <cassidy> @shroud true true, for some reason when talking 1st person I'm thinking of solo's and not teams competing

[7/28/17, 4:08:31 AM] <SNM34> the main thing with 1st person is that people won't be able to camp behind a tree and wait for you to move to shoot you
[7/28/17, 4:08:32 AM] <kurib> @damg0n root yes, overall not so much
[7/28/17, 4:08:34 AM] <icelus__> 4x4x4 = 64x scope right
[7/28/17, 4:08:40 AM] <Mineralx> not that harder to loot if you tab looot
[7/28/17, 4:08:45 AM] <kurib> @UndergroundBitcoinHitman no?
[7/28/17, 4:08:46 AM] <kasoysavage> @wiggan92 oh k thank you!

[7/28/17, 4:08:51 AM] <pai_gwut> im not sure if looting will be that different because the loot spawn spots are all the same. you can just stand over them and press tab
[7/28/17, 4:08:52 AM] <Atropox> try playing in first person for a bit!

[7/28/17, 9:12:07 AM] <Mr_SamuelAdam> @Vivulux to say someone is a stream sniping with no actual proof is shit and many people reported him, not good.

[7/28/17, 9:12:10 AM] <charlesiil> @Seedyy01 someone who stream sniped summit and shroud
[7/28/17, 9:12:10 AM] <CarlXVlGustaf> like the ban is probably justified too since they played against apexxero more than once...
[7/28/17, 9:12:14 AM] <cjh_tv> no thats not possible is it? you got the "3 kill"
[7/28/17, 9:12:15 AM] <Yahirqtony> @jenniferconnelly ???

[7/28/17, 9:12:16 AM] <ign1tetv> Just because he called the dude out, doesn't mean he got him banned. You guys are actually stupid if you believe that he got the guy banned
