[6/4/17, 7:45:28 AM] <MidasGGX> PogChamp ui
[6/4/17, 7:45:28 AM] <Luigiatl> @SlyVII ok I'm sorry my opinion doesn't align with yours
[6/4/17, 7:45:30 AM] <dngz0> 16-0
[6/4/17, 7:45:32 AM] <ilnertooo> @PGL Why you do dis :( Hope this HUD won't be used at major
[6/4/17, 7:45:33 AM] <tdpoulos> It seems a bit slow
[6/4/17, 7:45:33 AM] <msucsgo> @PGL it''s bugged, when he defused it stuck to 0,97sec for a while
[6/4/17, 7:45:34 AM] <mainframe_zp> BnTeT underperforming
[6/4/17, 7:45:36 AM] <stmpancho> @PGL bomb timer is confuse
[6/4/17, 7:45:39 AM] <TSM_TheSaltyOne> Wtf hud??
[6/4/17, 7:45:41 AM] <blizzka92> yeah bomb timer was strange
[6/4/17, 7:45:43 AM] <pro_cs_player> i like hud
[6/4/17, 7:45:49 AM] <LC303> @ilnert_o why? its good lol
[6/4/17, 7:45:49 AM] <Cujo_au> @pgl defuse timer keeps resetting instead of one smooth animation
[6/4/17, 7:45:50 AM] <LuckyMaxxer> @PGL the players names on the side is way too low. Your eyes are in the middle not the bottom
[6/4/17, 7:45:51 AM] <PGL> @ilnert_o it will be
[6/4/17, 7:45:52 AM] <msucsgo> @PGL and the milliseconds fu*k it up
[6/4/17, 7:45:52 AM] <cira53> @Ch33se_ he isnt playing
[6/4/17, 7:45:56 AM] <waddaboss> Don't need the players photo @pgl
[6/4/17, 7:45:59 AM] <ice_wallow_come_04> @PGL good job on the HUD, don't mind the kids that complain 24/7, it's great
[6/4/17, 7:46:04 AM] <piscolits> waaaaaaw
[6/4/17, 7:46:11 AM] <hazimk9> HRllo

[6/4/17, 7:46:19 AM] <mainframe_zp> @Cira53 ?
[6/4/17, 7:46:19 AM] <LC303> @PGL ye the defuse timer is kinda annoying how it ticks back and forth but everything else 10/10
[6/4/17, 7:46:22 AM] <Luigiatl> It looks flashy, but maybe not as usable as it could be
[6/4/17, 7:46:25 AM] <YoshiOfADown> @ilnert_o rekt LUL
[6/4/17, 7:46:25 AM] <hazimk9> kaze mann xD

[6/4/17, 7:46:31 AM] <tdpoulos> @PGL Nice HUD, It'll get a bit of time getting used to it but I do like it! Is it the finalised version?
[6/4/17, 7:46:36 AM] <DemoniCgg> @PGL why does the twitch stream have a bigger delay than the stream on b365?
[6/4/17, 7:46:40 AM] <Maxreiger> @PGL Is this the Battle HUD 2.0 Kappa
[6/4/17, 7:46:40 AM] <jordan00mcclain> give me attention SwiftRage BabyRage BabyRage
[6/4/17, 7:46:41 AM] <ka7ev> @Costrad yes
[6/4/17, 7:46:48 AM] <cira53> @Ch33se_ i think tyloo manager using bntet's account
[6/4/17, 7:46:48 AM] <Azylu> @PGL Can you make the primary guns on the HUD, a different color? very hard to see on blue and gold
[6/4/17, 7:46:50 AM] <任务魔术> this hud reminds me good 1.6 matches <3 good job @PGL
[6/4/17, 7:46:52 AM] <AndyMM1> c9 should pick up one of these guys for shroud
[6/4/17, 7:46:54 AM] <piscolits> :V
[6/4/17, 7:46:57 AM] <Botford> @PGL good job on the hud guys, something different to add to the major :-)
[6/4/17, 7:46:57 AM] <Cujo_au> Guys relax, this is the first time it's been used for live game play, there's going to be bugs to iron out
[6/4/17, 7:47:04 AM] <overkillzy1989> that looked like tyloo
[6/4/17, 7:47:06 AM] <senseigh0st> @PGL It would be nice to have a health bar maybe under the middle bar
[6/4/17, 7:47:11 AM] <hanjoflubby> comeback

[6/4/17, 7:47:20 AM] <nicholas90_tan> GG tyloo first win coming LOL
[6/4/17, 7:47:21 AM] <PGL> defuse is bugged, working on it
[6/4/17, 7:47:23 AM] <senseigh0st> It's just slightly confusing not seeing a physical health bar
[6/4/17, 7:47:25 AM] <fows> @PGL the hud is good. i like it. anyway u can find to make it more simple would be good.
[6/4/17, 7:47:27 AM] <Hektik7> bugs should be fixedd before its aired to 3k people
[6/4/17, 7:47:27 AM] <siukitgames> 024 bntet lmao
[6/4/17, 7:47:35 AM] <Azylu> @Cujo_au Tell me who thought white on light blue was a good idea, can barely see the guns the players have
[6/4/17, 7:47:39 AM] <AndyMM1> @Cujo_au it could use a little refining but this ui is cooler imo
[6/4/17, 7:47:40 AM] <trungquan09> Kaze still hurt
[6/4/17, 7:47:43 AM] <Imp6> fucking cool hud guys @pgl congratz!
[6/4/17, 7:47:43 AM] <任务魔术> @YoshiOfADown he's onliner 4Head
[6/4/17, 7:47:46 AM] <hazimk9> kaze is no an awper...
[6/4/17, 7:47:47 AM] <Luigiatl> It's definitely an adjustment the viewers have to make, that's for sure
[6/4/17, 7:47:49 AM] <nicholas90_tan> FLASH work well easy 3.02ODD ez income 5000USD
[6/4/17, 7:47:58 AM] <SlooperSoaker> is there a way i could get that mini map in my hud?
[6/4/17, 7:48:02 AM] <Azylu> @impairedcsgo Yeah, but you cant see the guns they have lmoa, its horrible
[6/4/17, 7:48:06 AM] <berwickmex> so is BnTeT playing or is that a stand-in?
[6/4/17, 7:48:09 AM] <LC303> @phreakcs no it doesnt lmao

[6/4/17, 7:48:28 AM] <msucsgo> @SlooperSoaker yes if PGL gives out the files or you make it yourself
[6/4/17, 7:48:29 AM] <Dezfanzer> BnTeT not playing
[6/4/17, 7:48:30 AM] <LC303> @Asylum_TA what do u mean bro? u can see the guns fine
[6/4/17, 7:48:31 AM] <d1am0nd5> Why it look different
[6/4/17, 7:48:32 AM] <Fohrenbach> @PGL ignore the haters we love u bb
[6/4/17, 7:48:35 AM] <giovannigiorgiomoroder> @PGL the minimap looks great
[6/4/17, 7:48:39 AM] <mainframe_zp> @PGL Is BnTeT playing or nah
[6/4/17, 7:48:40 AM] <Dezfanzer> It is his manager
[6/4/17, 7:48:59 AM] <PGL> @Ch33se_ he is

[6/4/17, 7:49:17 AM] <emilisblue> I would love to have this design
[6/4/17, 7:49:18 AM] <cira53> @PGL it isnt bruuh
[6/4/17, 7:49:18 AM] <waddaboss> CaptainLol
[6/4/17, 7:49:18 AM] <Luigiatl> @PGL I think it might be helpful if you represent the bomb time in numbers/seconds, rather than a bar, but that's just my opinion
[6/4/17, 7:49:18 AM] <stevenrc11> fix the bomb please
[6/4/17, 7:49:21 AM] <kappaacademy> is headshot one shot one kill?
[6/4/17, 7:49:21 AM] <Diesel_J> :(

[6/4/17, 7:49:54 AM] <icalucard> he isnot bntet, he is the manager
[6/4/17, 7:49:55 AM] <fows> @yqaddur1 not always. with ak its always, with snipers always, with deagle always. all other guns only when other guy has no head armor
[6/4/17, 7:49:56 AM] <alexb_18> who?
[6/4/17, 7:49:59 AM] <AsimEU> @yqaddur1 depends on gun and if the player has head armor or not
[6/4/17, 7:50:00 AM] <Imp6> seriously, fucking dope hud! @pgl
[6/4/17, 7:50:02 AM] <PGL> @Luigiatl no because we lose some hype if you know the exact time you have till it explodes
[6/4/17, 7:50:02 AM] <Cujo_au> It's just something we'll have to get used to guys
[6/4/17, 7:50:05 AM] <jon_basauri> in the radar ct's blue is more like grey isnt it?
[6/4/17, 7:50:05 AM] <coachswag> this hud is insane Kreygasm
[6/4/17, 7:50:05 AM] <phreakcs> The font is bad, something sans serif would look better, also I liked the flags behind the logos.
[6/4/17, 7:50:08 AM] <LC303> @PGL also why does it say Summer in kill feeds instead of fancy
[6/4/17, 7:50:09 AM] <Milohaoo> fking hud .. So fucking small
[6/4/17, 7:50:11 AM] <piscolits> waaaaaw
[6/4/17, 7:50:12 AM] <waddaboss> @pgl troll
[6/4/17, 7:50:13 AM] <Fohrenbach> lag on killfeed tho?
[6/4/17, 7:50:19 AM] <SlooperSoaker> @pgl anyway i could get that minimap for my hud?
[6/4/17, 7:50:19 AM] <giovannigiorgiomoroder> @PGL can u make health red if hp is low enough?
[6/4/17, 7:50:19 AM] <AlenTaggart> where is bntet ;<
[6/4/17, 7:50:21 AM] <PGL> @phreakcs it CSGO font
[6/4/17, 7:50:22 AM] <Dezfanzer> @PGL If BnTeT playing can i see him? real face
[6/4/17, 7:50:23 AM] <critians321> @PGL you smart
[6/4/17, 7:50:25 AM] <FableNightmare> I like the middle section of the hud with the player, but the outside is little rough imo
[6/4/17, 7:50:28 AM] <Luigiatl> @pgl Okay, if that's what you think, I'm all for it. Excited to see the major!
[6/4/17, 7:50:28 AM] <Rocketmania96> BotTet 0-7 LULO

[6/4/17, 7:50:46 AM] <stareways> woah what happened to stram, update?
[6/4/17, 7:50:48 AM] <Diesel_J> KDA would be good
[6/4/17, 7:50:50 AM] <cira53> @Dezfanzer ofc its not bntet, PGL try to manipulate bntet hltv rating xDD
[6/4/17, 7:50:50 AM] <Madza89> Sh*t desing of hud, backup classic csgo hud...
[6/4/17, 7:50:54 AM] <Costrad> bntet did 0 kill
[6/4/17, 7:50:55 AM] <Dezfanzer> That is not BnTeT he's not even getting 1 kill
[6/4/17, 7:50:55 AM] <Costrad> LOL
[6/4/17, 7:50:57 AM] <mainframe_zp> this layout is chode
[6/4/17, 7:50:58 AM] <Fohrenbach> hud elements get lost on less than 1080 for the plebs
[6/4/17, 7:50:59 AM] <ice_wallow_come_04> KDA would be great
[6/4/17, 7:50:59 AM] <giovannigiorgiomoroder> KDA is there
[6/4/17, 7:51:00 AM] <Rocketmania96> FAKE Bntet???
[6/4/17, 7:51:01 AM] <waddaboss> Timer sucks
[6/4/17, 7:51:02 AM] <ChillieWillie> this layout looks sick
[6/4/17, 7:51:04 AM] <Floxiiik> lmao the hud looks so sick
[6/4/17, 7:51:04 AM] <LC303> @Hookup5 it shows k/a/d at start of round
[6/4/17, 7:51:06 AM] <Diesel_J> kda when they die yeah
[6/4/17, 7:51:07 AM] <phreakcs> @PGL I understand but this UI has a modern look and a sans serif font would make it look good
[6/4/17, 7:51:08 AM] <Beef2102> no way
[6/4/17, 7:51:11 AM] <LuckyMaxxer> @PGL the names on the sidebar need to be raised to the middle. Our eyes are in the middle and it diverts attention looking down
[6/4/17, 7:51:12 AM] <Diesel_J> or when they start i mean
[6/4/17, 7:51:14 AM] <regastmet> lol bntet 0/2/6
[6/4/17, 7:51:15 AM] <Blink925> is BnTet playing ?

[6/4/17, 7:51:38 AM] <LC303> yea the kdr should be there during the round imo
[6/4/17, 7:51:39 AM] <Madza89> yeah, new hud is sick
[6/4/17, 7:51:41 AM] <Cujo_au> K/A/D is at the start of the round, but I wouldn't mind seeing it during the round too.
[6/4/17, 7:51:41 AM] <Nofaldii> bntet too tired too carry this noob
[6/4/17, 7:51:41 AM] <zQueeZeh> BnTeT 0/6 🤔
[6/4/17, 7:51:42 AM] <Costrad> i think the placement of player hp bar is too low @PGL

[6/4/17, 11:44:48 AM] <Danrulio> @PuiuCS I think the sentiment is that the official stream is going to be more accurate than the reddit match ticker
